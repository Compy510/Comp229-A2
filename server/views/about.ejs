    <p>
        My name is Arshad Khan and I am currently a student in the 
        <strong>Health Informatics Technology</strong> program at Centennial College.
        I prevously studied Biomedical Sciences at the university of Ottawa where I graduated 
        with a Bachelor of Science degree. Some of my hobbies include watching and playing soccer,
        watching netflix, sleeping and of course coding :)
        <br> 
        An interesting fact about me is that I used to play soccer semi-professionally when I was 16 
        and had gotten scouted to play for Juventus. However, due to an injury, 
        I had to give up playing for a couple of years and decided to focus more on school instead.
        This has lead me to discovering my passion for both science and computer programming, where 
        I hope to one day create a program that can make a difference in the world.
